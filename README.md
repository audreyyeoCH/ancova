# Reproducibility project

Dr. Simon Schwab and I are in re-analyzing studies using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) published in highly ranked journals and in the fields of medicine, multidisciplinary science, neuroscience and psychiatry. We want to explore how many studies share data when requested and if we are able to reanalyze results from ANCOVA. Our study has been registered and the protocol is available here: https://osf.io/tjngz/.

We thank all our willing contributors to this re-analysis in these areas of study.
