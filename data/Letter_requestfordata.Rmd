Dear Pr.  Dr. (context specific)

Dr Simon Schwab and I are Scientists at the Centre for Reproducible Science, University of Zurich, Switzerland. We are interested in re-analyzing the primary outcomes of all the trials that have been used Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) by highly ranked journals and in the fields of medicine, psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience. We want to understand how ANCOVA is used by these fields.

Our study is registered here: 
XXXX
and our protocol can be found here:
XXXX

Our study designed involves sampling some articles matching the aforementioned criteria. Your study  entitled ‘XXXX’ recently published in ‘XXXX” is one such study we had sampled. I would greatly appreciate if you can share with us the data from this study and exact which are your Dependant variables, Independent Variables and Covariates. To make this a productive process, we would additionally appreciate any analysis code that might be relevant to your ANCOVA analyses if different estimates are obtained on our end, so we can properly understand yours with minimal effort on your part as possible.

The findings of our study is aimed at informing ourselves best teaching and statistical practices in these important fields. More information of our centre is mentioned below. We thank you for your assistance in advance. Please reach out to us if you have any questions and we would be happy to elaborate more on the purpose of our study.  

Best regards,
